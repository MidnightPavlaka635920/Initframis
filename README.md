# Initframis
## About
Initframis is a program that transfers videos to ASCII full or half characters.
I got the idea from rickroll in terminal.
Sadly, this doesn't work on Windows CMD. I don't know about powershell, or any other consoles, but it works on Linux.
## Deoendencies
-This is a C++ project, so you will need g++ for compiling in Linux or something else on Windows.
-OpenCV is core of this project. It handles video loading, Pixel reading, etc.
-ffmpeg cause ooenCV should be compiled with ffmpeg.
